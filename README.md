# Student_Report
\\This is a **Student Performance Prediction Web App** built using **Streamlit** and **Machine Learning**. The app predicts a studentâ€™s final grade (G3) based on factors like first and second period grades (G1, G2), number of absences, study time, and failures using a trained regression model. It features an interactive web interface for inputting student details, generating predictions, and visualizing results. The project includes an easy-to-run `app.py` file, a `requirements.txt` for dependencies, and is designed for deployment on **Streamlit Cloud**. The dataset used is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.
